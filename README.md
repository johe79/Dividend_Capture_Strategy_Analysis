# Dividend_Capture_Strategy_Analysis

# This project constitutes the final portfolio project in Codecademy's "Business Intelligence Data Analyst" career path.

# The inspiration came from a friend's trading strategy. Thus, wanting to base my project on a "real-life" problem, I decided to use his 
# trading strategy as a vantage point by using the computational powers of python to assess the strategy's attractiveness, viability and risks.

# As such, this my first "live" project which undoubtedly is reflected by the quite messy code. I have tried my best to clean it up, but yeah, its not
# pretty. Also, I am well aware that some parts could be done much more elegantly and even that some of the code is unnecessary, but after having 
# worked with it over several months I was VERY eager to finish it. Having said this, constructive criticism and recommendations are welcome.
